Task 3 

Problem statement

Deploy the Employee Management system to Google Cloud


Aim of the problem

Deploy your REST APIs developed for the employee management system on GCP and develop understanding of how the different GCP services work which help software engineers develop serverless micro-services.

What is Expected -
1. The REST API code should be deployed on cloud functions which are unauthenticated(accessible over the internet)
2. Migrate your DB from CSV to GCP firestore collections.
3. Provide IAM access required to save data in firestore from cloud functions
4. Each CRUD operation as per the previous task should be performed by respective cloud function
5. Each of the API calls from previous task should now work from the swagger definition.
6. Milestone 1 - deploy the GCP resources manually through console using the GCP console UI
6. Milestone 2 - deploy the GCP resources manually through console as packaged zips
7. Good to have - deploy the resources through terraform
 
* Key evaluation points
1. Code best practices
2. All improvements from last tasks should be included
3. Understanding of cloud services, developing and deploying resource on GCP.
4. Viva/questionnaire on GCP
5. Initial understanding of end to end development of serverless microservices
